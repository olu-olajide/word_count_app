# Word Counter

## Overview
This Python script, `word_counter.py`, analyzes a text file and prints a count of how often each word appears, sorted by frequency from most to least common. It's designed to provide insights into the composition of any given text document.

## Features
- Counts occurrences of each word in a text file.
- Displays the word counts sorted by their frequency.
- Handles words in a case-insensitive manner for accurate counting.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
To use the script, navigate to the directory containing `word_counter.py` in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
python3 word_counter.py

Replace `path/to/your/file.txt` in the script with the actual path to the text file you wish to analyze before running the command.

## Example
If your file example.txt contains the text "Hello world! Hello!", the output will be:

hello: 2
world: 1
